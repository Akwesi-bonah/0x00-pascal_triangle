# N-Queens Puzzle Solver

This is a Python program that solves the N-Queens puzzle. The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Usage

To run the program, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. The program takes a single command-line argument, which specifies the size of the chessboard and the number of queens to be placed. Here's the syntax:

```shell
python3 0-nqueens.py 4
```

# output
```
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```
